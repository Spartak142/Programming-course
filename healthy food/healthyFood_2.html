            Coffee drinkers may live longer</a></h2>
        <a href="#"><img src="images/Coffee-drinkers.jpg" alt="1post"></a>
        <p>Coffee lovers will be happy with a new study that associates their daily habit, whether enjoyed with a little
          sugar or not, with a lowered risk of premature death.
          <br><br>
          The large Chinese study adds to previous evidence of coffee consumption being associated with a lower risk of
          early death, compared with not drinking coffee, but has a slightly different spin because the researchers also
          looked at whether adding sugar to your coffee makes a difference.
          <br><br>
          The results show coffee drinkers were less likely to die during a seven-year follow-up period than non-coffee
          drinkers, regardless of whether they added sugar to their brew or not.
          <br><br>
          The researchers found participants who drank any amount of unsweetened coffee were 16 to 21 per cent less
          likely to die, during the seven-year follow up period, than participants who did not drink coffee. And
          participants who drank 1.5 to 3.5 daily cups of coffee sweetened with sugar were 29 to 31 per cent less likely
          to die than non-coffee drinkers.
          <br><br>
          But the results for those who sweetened their coffee with artificial sweeteners were less clear, the
          researchers say.
          <br><br>
          They note that those who drank sugar-sweetened coffee usually added only about 1 teaspoon of sugar, so the
          effects may be different for people who are a bit heavy handed with the sugar spoon.</p>
